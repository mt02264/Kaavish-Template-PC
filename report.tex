\chapter*{Dedication}
When we started this work, we lived in a different world. There were many difficulties that our project faced as each of us had to distance ourselves and stay at home because of COVID-19 pandemic. It was a difficult time but we had some massive support. This work is dedicated to our family for making sure we could work in a good environment, our faculty who were always supportive, our friends who understood the pain we were going through. Most importantly, the reason why we started this project in the first place, we dedicate it to a cleaner Karachi and a better future for all.


\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
We would first and foremost like to acknowledge our supervisor Dr. Waqar Saleem who guided us throughout our journey and provided us with timely and effective feedback so that we keep moving forward. We would also like to thank Dr. Abdul Samad, Dr. Umair Azfar, Dr. Taj Khan and Miss Nadia Nasir for evaluating us and providing great feedback as well. A big acknowledgment goes to Kaavish committee and Habib University Administration for making sure all logistical operations, from providing us space to work till scheduling things, became possible. Last and but not the least, we would like to acknowledge the entire student body, faculty, and the community of Habib University who helped all of us individually as well as a group through these tough times.



\chapter*{Abstract}
Karachi, Pakistanâ€™s largest city, generates more than 13,500 tons of municipal waste daily. All major cities face enormous challenges on how to manage urban waste \cite{WasteManage}. So, in an attempt to move towards solving a big part of the huge problem that the garbage crisis encompasses, we have developed a system that will aid the garbage collection process in Karachi. \\
\\
The system does so by allowing users to capture/upload images of garbage dumps in their locality. It then coarsely segments the garbage, quantifies it, and map out an efficient route on the admin panel. This route mapping aids the garbage collection process as it provides the route to the garbage pickup trucks. It can be used as an efficient tool of resource management and allocation.\\
\\
The system is divided into three major components; the user application, the cloud model and the web application which is an interface for the administrator. The cloud model further consist of two major processes: The identification of the garbage (building upon the work of SpotGarbage) and the Quantification of the Garbage.Our system is completely cloud-based and uses Google Cloud Services and Storage.\\
